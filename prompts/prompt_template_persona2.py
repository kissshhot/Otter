# Impact of network delays on Hyperledger Fabric. Blockchain has become one of the most attractive technologies for applications, with a large range of deployments such as production, economy, or banking. Under the hood, Blockchain technology is a type of distributed database that supports untrusted parties. In this paper we focus Hyperledger Fabric, the first blockchain in the market tailored for a private environment, allowing businesses to create a permissioned network. Hyperledger Fabric implements a PBFT consensus in order to maintain a non forking blockchain at the application level. We deployed this framework over an area network between France and Germany in order to evaluate its performance when potentially large network delays are observed. Overall we found that when network delay increases significantly (i.e. up to 3.5 seconds at network layer between two clouds), we observed that the blocks added to our blockchain had up to 134 seconds offset after 100 th block from one cloud to another. Thus by delaying block propagation, we demonstrated that Hyperledger Fabric does not provide sufficient consistency guaranties to be deployed in critical environments. Our work, is the fist to evidence the negative impact of network delays on a PBFT based blockchain.

# Don't waste your time even just simply flipping through this magazine at the newstand. Trust me... there will be no worthwhile patterns (I mean... just look at what they choose to grace their cover!!!) I have stopped hoping for even a half way decent pattern to come along during the two years or so. I have seen litteraly only ONE knittable pattern in the last three years (December 2004 I believe it was... a lace cardigan with beaded trim). Even the articles are pointless. Save your time and money and get a subscription to Interweave Knits or Vogue Knitting. Or opt for a new magazine (not available at all newstands in the US) called Simply Knitting, which is imported from the UK. It amazes me that this magazine is even still in production with how horible it is!!
